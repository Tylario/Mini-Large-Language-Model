His club and insurance company ensured that a large sum of money went his way. One day, he decided to invest his money in a small but growing sportswear business. He bought the company outright but after signing on the dotted line, realized that he knew nothing about business. He decided to employ someone to run the shop. The next day he set up three interviews. The first guy was great. He knew everything he needed to and was very enthusiastic. At the end of the interview, the former rugby player asked him, Do you notice anything different about me? And the man replied, Why, yes, I couldnt help noticing you have no ears. The rugby player got angry and threw him out. The second interview was with a woman, and she was even better than the first guy. He asked her the same question, Do you notice anything different about me? She replied: Well, you have no ears. He got upset again and showed her the door. The third and last interview was with the best of the three. He was a very young man fresh out of college. He was smart and handsome and seemed to know all about the sportswear business. The rugby player was anxious, but went ahead and asked him the same question: Do you notice anything different about me? To his surprise the young man answered: Yes, you wear contact lenses. The former rugby player was shocked, and said, What an incredibly observant young man you are. How in the world did you know that?

Ever since they were young they wouldn't talk about sex publicly, but instead developed a code phrase: Doing a load of laundry. One night they are out at the pub, having a couple drinks, and Seamus turns to Mary and asks "D'ya fancy going home and doing a load of laundry?" Mary looks at Seamus and says "you know that sounds lovely. Let's do." They finish their drinks and head home together. At home they are sitting in front of the fire, Seamus smoking his pipe and Mary with her knitting. Seamus asks "Mary? D'ya still fancy that load of laundry?" Mary looks at Seamus and says "aye I do, I really do. Let me just finish my knitting." So Seamus gets up and heads to the bed room. Mary keeps knitting and forgets all about Seamus. After an hour she realizes she forgot and jumps up and rushes to the bedroom. "Seamus?" Mary asks, "D'ya still fancy doing a load of laundry?" From under the covers Seamus replies "Y'know, Mary, it was a small load, so I did it by hand."  These reports of a major snowstorm hitting the Northeast don't concern me. It's all just flake news.

There's a bizarre black-market concession stand in North America which sells only human body parts Customers who wish to purchase an item must use code-phrases to avoid the authorities' suspicion. One night a blind man stops by the stand. "What would you like to purchase today?" asks the cashier. "Oh, nothing" the blind man says, "I was just looking around!" An few hours later, a deaf man approaches the stand. The cashier realizes he can't hear him, and uses sign-language to ask what he'd like to purchase. "Well, I heard you guys are having a sale!" the deaf man states with a wink and a nudge. Finally, just before that night's closing time, a muscular man with no apparent disability walks up to the stand. The cashier asks what he'd like to purchase. "I don't know ... I heard you guys sold cherries!" the man states with a look of subtle expectation. The cashier, despite going through his mental checklist of code-phrases, has no idea what he wants. "I'm sorry, we've sold-out on that item." the cashier says with a puzzled stare. "Ah motherfucking christ!" the man screams in pseudo-frustration. However, the cashier just stands there with an agitated face. The customer, realizing his attempts aren't getting through to the employee, tries a different approach. "Well, that's a darn shame!" he continues. "And I travelled across the entire count-" The man coughs. "-ry to get here!"

A flood warning is given, but the local priest decides to stay... The water level starts rising, but he has faith that God will save him. As the water is up to his knees, an old man in a rowboat sails up to him. "Hey," he says. "Need a lift?" The priest shakes his head. "No thank you, I have faith that the lord will save me. Use your boat to find those more in need." The rowboat heads off, and soon the water is up to the priest's chest. A rescue boat loaded with supplies comes racing up to him. "Grab my hand!" the captain yells. "We gotta get out of here!" "No!" The priest yells. "There are others who need help. I assure you, the lord will save me!" Reluctantly, the rescue boat rides off. As the water continues to rise, the priest is forced to the roof of his house. A helicopter flies over to him and lowers a winch. "Hold on!" Shouts the winchman as he holds out his hand. But the priest again shakes his head. "No! The lord will save me! Go save someone else!" Frustrated, the helicopter flies away. Sadly, the water becomes too much for the priest to deal with and he goes under. He finds himself in heaven, absolutely stunned. After going through the pearly gates, he walks straight up to God himself. "Lord," the priest says, "I spent my life devoted to you.

Yeah, theyre going to name it The Trannies  Joe bought a gun . . . Joe bought a gun. He walked right into the sporting goods store, up to the gun counter, and picked out a semi-automatic .12 gauge shotgun with a box of buckshot shells. The entire process took no more than twenty minutes. Joe left town and drove for a couple hours before exiting the highway and driving down a winding county road for another ten minutes. Joe pulled into a service station and parked his car. He sat in his vehicle, loaded five shells into his new Benelli shotgun, and chambered in a shell. Joe clicked off the safety and walked into the convenience store. There was no one in sight but the attendant behind the counter. Her name was Janice. She tried to run when she saw the shotgun but Joe shot her as she turned. She took some buckshot to the brain and died almost instantly. Joe walked behind the counter, stepping carefully over Janice, picked up the phone, and dialed 911. "I've killed a lady. I'm robbing the store," Joe told the 911 operator. He then emptied the cash register, walked out to his vehicle, and drove away. A short ways down the road, Joe came upon another service station. He pulled in and exited his vehicle. The owner of the service station was a capable man named Bill. Bill saw the look in Joe's eyes when Joe approached the door of the service station, and he saw the gun in his hand. Bill was ready with his own shotgun by the time Joe raised his, and Bill pumped a slug into Joe's abdomen. Bill immediately called for an ambulance and approached Joe with compassion. "Let me help you, son." As Bill tended to Joe's wounds as best as he could, it became clear that Joe might not survive. Bill asked him, "Why did you do it, son? Why did you bring that damn gun into my store? I had to shoot you. What, were you going to rob me? Why?" As the light of life flickered in Joe's eyes, with his dying breath he responded, "Damn it all. Shamu and Moby Dick put me up to it. They are waiting outside for me right now. I'm gonna go get them. Be right back, mister." And with that, Joe died. Bill would go on to give a full account of Joe's actions and his last words to the police and to the press. Then, the following morning, the Sunday paper headline read, "The Outlaw Joe Sees Whales"  My pal is a comedian.

The husband looked over at his wife bent over her flower bed and said "ya know honey, I never really noticed how big your ass is. Why, I bet it's just as wide as the range on the grill." To prove his point, the man went and grabbed the tape measure out of his toolbox. First he measured the width of the grill then his wife's bottom. "Yep, just as thought. It really is as big as the grill." The wife got offended and stormed back into the house. Later that night, laying in bed, the husband started feeling frisky. He put his arm around hia wife and said "hey honey, what do ya say we fool around a little bit?".

He meets the second man, who looks quite astonished. "You know, I saw that with my own eyes, but that must have been a one time fluke." "No, I'll prove it again," says the first man as he jumps again. Just as he is hurtling toward the street, the 10th floor wind gently carries him around the building and into the window.

They are also the ones that people will trim to prevent birds from flying away. Crows have 5 pinion feathers while ravens have 6. So, if you think about it, it's really just a matter of a pinion."
